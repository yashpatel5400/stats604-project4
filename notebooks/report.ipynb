    "ARIMA, which stands for Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average, are general model for time series forecasting. The ARIMA model for stationary time series are linear regression model and one set of its predictors are lags of the variables to be predicted.  A key concept in time series modeling is stationarity, which roughly says that the statistical properties of the time series are constant over time. The time series may not be stationary as it is, so we have to apply some linear/non-linear transformation to the data to bring stationarity. For example, differencing is a popular technique to bring stationarity. Suppose $Y_t$ be the maximum temperature at time stamp $t$. Then, the time series $\\{Y_t\\}_{t \\geq 1}$ may not be stationary, but the differenced variable $y_t = Y_{t} - Y_{t-1}$ perhaps is. Generally, we may have to use higher order of differencing. For example, a second order differencing involves transforming time series to $y_{t} = (Y_{t} - Y_{t-1}) - (Y_{t-1} - Y_{t-2})$. On top of lagged difference of the variable, this model can also use the forecast errors in the past time steps, which are called moving average components. These errors denoted by $\\{\\epsilon_t\\}_{t \\geq 1}$ are assumped to be iid $\\text{Normal}(0,1)$. Therefore, an ARIMA model with $p$ auto-regressive component, $d$ order of differencing, and $q$ moving average components is \n",

    "In addition, while Gradient Boosting can be used to make predictions when the response variable is a scalar, Random Forests can be trained and used for tasks when the response variable is a vector. To this end, we trained one Random Forest for each station, each of which outputs 15 predictions corresponding to the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for the next 5 days. Thus, only a total of 20 Random Forests were trained. Each Random Forest used 100 Regression Trees of depth 5. In addition, the same covariates as in the Regression models and Gradient Boosting were also used for each of the Random Forest Models. The model class below formalizes this idea in code. Note that like the Regression-based models and Gradient Boosting, we can also use the MetaPredictor here by passing in a Random Forest regression model into the constructor of the MetaPredictor model class.

More specifically, we simulated the exact same prediction process for 10 days between Nov 30 - Dec 10th across 5 different years. For each year and each model, we compute the average Mean Squared Error (MSE) of that model's predictions for each of the 10 days. That is, for a given model, year, and day, the MSE was computed between the 300 temperature measurements predicted by the model and the true 300 temperature measurements corresponding to the min, avg, and max temperatures across all 20 stations for the next 5 days. This means, that for one particular year, each model had 10 MSE values, one per day in that year. The code below computes and prints these MSE values for the PrevDay model across all the years."

    "Although the weather is caused by atmospheric change that can, in principle, be described by laws of physics, we found that statistical modeling of the weather can be rather challenging. One key challenge is including all the  atmospheric factors that determine the weather in our statistical model. Nevertheless, we found that the weather can be predicted with  reasonable accuracy even with a few macro factors using regression-based and ensemble models. With the right set of features and large training data, it may be possible to predict temperature fairly accurately by just using highly expressive statistical models. Finally, combining statistical models with physics-based constraints is an exciting future direction for weather prediction. \n",

    "Cross validation was set up so as to replicate the exact evaluation criteria of this project.  Specifically, for the years 2017-2021 we trained our possible models on the previous years data and then performed predictions for the dates Nov 30 - Dec 10.  The total MSE across stations, days, and max/min/avg temperature was computed to produce a final error metric for a given year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we found that ensemble models such as random forest, and gradient boosting as well as regression based models such as OLS and MLP were able to outperform naive baseline models on our validation set.  Interestingly, time series based models did not perform as well.  In the end, the ensemble model random forest gave the best cross validation performance and was selected for our final prediction."
